<h1 align="center">MATB-II</h1>

## üìú Description:
On the search for a web-compatible implementation of MATB-II for my seminar "Positive Information Systems" I stumbled upon a Unity implementation by [Akash Ramjyothi](https://github.com/Akash-Ramjyothi).
Other implementations like OpenMATB did sadly not satisfy my requirements of running the application on the Browser inside my oTree experiment.
Firstly, I isolated the Unity project from the surrounding python code to make it easier to embed the project into different experiment setups or applications using (for example) the WebGL Build of Unity.
Next, migrated the project from Unity 2019 to the latest Unity Version and updated legacy components and the design for a more modern and functional look and feel. I also improved a lot of the code structure and documentation.
